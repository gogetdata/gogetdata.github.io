Welcome to the Go Get Data documentation!
=========================================

**ggd** is a data managment system that provides access to data package containing auto curated genomic data.
ggd hosts data packages that contain information on how to extract and process scientific data, providinig access
to a growing number of scientific datasets without the hassel of finding, downloading, and processing them
yourself. ggd leverages the `conda <http://conda.pydata.org/docs/intro.html>`_ package managment system 
and the infastructure of `Bioconda <https://bioconda.github.io/index.html>`_ to provide a stable source
of dataset and annotation repdroducibility. Using the ggd data managment system allows any user to quickly
access a desired dataset(s), and provides a stable way to cite data acess and use by refering to the ggd 
data package name and version. 

ggd consist of:

- a `repository of recipes <https://github.com/gogetdata/ggd-recipes>`_ hosted on Github
- a `comand line interface (cli) <https://github.com/gogetdata/ggd-cli>`_ to communicate with the ggd system
- a continually growing list of genomic recipes to provide easy and quick access to processed genomic data
  using the ggd cli tool


.. When using ggd please **cite our article** `author list <>`_.


Available Data Packages
-----------------------
You can see and search for available packages using the :ref:`Avaiable packages <recipes>` page of the 
ggd documentation

If you have the ggd cli tool installed, you can use :code:`ggd search` to search for available pacakges

Using GGD
=========

1. Install conda 
----------------
Go Get Data (GGD) requires the conda package managment system be installed on your system. Loading conda from a module 
is not sufficient. Please install Anaconda or Miniconda onto your system. The best way to
install it is with the `Miniconda <http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html>`_
package. The Python 3 version is recommended

2. Configure the conda channels
--------------------------------
Go Get Data (GGD) data packages are stored in the Anaconda cloud. Additionaly, ggd uses software tools available from 
other software pacakges in conda. A GGD conda channel, and other required channels, need to be added to your conda
configurations. You can add as many GGD channels as you would like, as they are available, but only one of the available
ggd channels is required. As GGD becomes more widely used additional channels will be created to support different areas of 
research

Available ggd channels:

- ggd-genomics

Run the following commands, adding in additional ggd channels as desired:

.. code-block:: bash 

    conda config --add channels defaults
    conda config --add channels ggd-genomics
    conda config --add channels bioconda
    conda config --add channels conda-forge

3. Install ggd
--------------
Go Get Data (GGD) needs to be installed on your system before you can use it. Run the following commands to download the 
ggd cli:

.. code-block:: bash

    conda install -y --file https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gogetdata/ggd-cli/master/requirements.txt
    pip install ggd

4. GGD tools
------------
The Go Get Data (GGD) command line tool (cli) installed in step 3 has built-in tools for accessing and managing 
data packages. These tools include:

- :ref:`ggd search <ggd-search>` Search for a ggd data package
- :ref:`ggd install <ggd-install>` Install a ggd data package
- :ref:`ggd uninstall <ggd-uninstall>` Uninstall a ggd data package
- :ref:`ggd list-files <ggd-list-files>` List the files for an installed ggd package
- :ref:`ggd pkg-info <ggd-pkg-info>` Show a specific ggd package's info
- :ref:`ggd show-env <ggd-show-env>` Show the ggd specific enviroment variables
- :ref:`ggd from-bash <ggd-from-bash>` Create a ggd recipe from a bash script
- :ref:`ggd check-recipe <ggd-check-recipe>` Check/test a ggd recipe

5. Contributing to GGD
----------------------
We intend for Go Get Data (GGD) to become a widely used data managment system for genomics and other reserach areas.
GGD provides support for reproducibility through Conda's naming, version tracking, and dependency handling structure.
One major function of the ggd cli tools is to provide an easy way to add data pacakges to the data repository. 

We welcome and encourage everyone to contribute to the data repository hosted by ggd.

Instructions on how to create a data pacakge and add it to ggd can be found on the :ref:`Contribute <make-data-packages>` 
documentation pages
